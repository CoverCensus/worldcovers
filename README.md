# Covers


Welcome to _**Covers**_, a stampless cover and postmark catalog application

This build, nicknamed _Lightspeed_, is version **2.0.0**

> Another success is the post-office, with its educating energy augmented by cheapness and guarded by a certain religious sentiment in mankind; so that the power of a wafer or a drop of wax or gluten to guard a letter, as it flies over sea over land and comes to its address as if a battalion of artillery brought it, I look upon as a fine meter of civilization.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- _Ralph Waldo Emerson_

## Project Overview

Version strings follow the **MAJOR**(#?).**MINOR**(#?).**REVISION**(#?) format.  

Current planned Milestones are `alpha`, `beta`, and `rtm`.  

Currently only tested on Chromium (TODO: version?) on Windows 11, and Brave (1.82.170-arm64) on macOS Sequoia

For licensing details, see [LICENSE](LICENSE)

###  **Apps**:
* [Common Model](./common)
  * TODO: DESCRIBE HERE
* [WoCo Server](./woco)
  * TODO: DESCRIBE HERE
* [Frontend (React)](./frontend)
  * The public UI at [hellowoco.app](https://hellowoco.app) is a React SPA (e.g. from Lovable). Put the app in `frontend/`, run `npm run build`; Django serves it as the site home and all frontend routes. API and admin stay under `/api/` and `/admin/`.


For more details see [DESIGN.md](./docs/DESIGN.md)


## Building

### Quickstart

This project uses `pipenv`, and `django`. Make sure you have at least `python` 3.11 installed.

`dotenv` is used as well, but strictly for convenience.  It allows you to directly call `django-admin` for all project commands, instead of `python manage.py`. 

For building other targets, and instructions for packaging in preparation for deployment, see [BUILD.md](./docs/BUILD.md).

To have the site home and routes served by the React app (e.g. at hellowoco.app), add your frontend in [frontend/](./frontend) and **run `npm run build` there before deployment**. The built output (`frontend/dist/`) is not in git, so your **deploy must run the frontend build** (e.g. `cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build`) before starting Django. See [docs/DEPLOY.md](./docs/DEPLOY.md) and [frontend/README.md](./frontend/README.md).


## Configuration

### TODO

## Execution

To run **Covers** in Production mode, execute the following:
```sh
./TODO
```

To run both the backend and frontend in debug mode, execute the following instead:
```sh
./TODO
```

For information on how to run the separate sub-projects, and perform administrative actions post-deployment, see [RUNBOOK.md](./docs/RUNBOOK.md)
